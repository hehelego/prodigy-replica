## note on paper reading

Supported programs

- discrete probabilistic programs
- potentially unbounded looping
- over an infinite state space

Behavior specs

- standard distributions (geometric, uniform, etc.)
- finite convolutions of those distributions.

Solved problem: determine whether a program yields exactly the desired distribution _under all possible inputs_.

**remark** they are probably trying to find certain canonical form.
Kozen's transformer semantics.

- The denotational semantics of a program is a distribution transformer: takes a PGF and spits out another PGF.
- The program and the spec are encoded as PGF transformers.
- Whether it is the case: $\forall g . prog(g) = spec(g)$. Extensional equality.
- Second order PGF (SOP)
- Restricted programming language (guard is rectangular): so that they admit closed-form PGF.

**doubt** wow... Huge restriction. Without linear/affine guards, some common programs of practical value will not be encodable.  
**response to doubt** not exactly. At least affine operators are expressible. See appendix of the journal version 2205.01449.

### limitations of previous methods


Existing techniques mostly concern with approximations.
That is verifying or inferring _upper/lower bounds on various quantities_.

- assertion-violation probabilities.
- pre-expectations and moments.
- expected running time
- concentrations

They can only provide a digest of the probability distribution of the program.

In what scenario are these digests insufficient?

- Safety critical and security critical applications.
    - cryptography. Warning side-channel leak is ahead.

### second order PGF

The formal power series (FPS): 

$$
\sum_{\sigma\in\mathbb{N}^k} f(\sigma) \mathbf{X}^\sigma
$$

- $f(\sigma)$ is the coefficient, and
- $\mathbf{X}^\sigma = \prod_{j=1}^k X_j^{\sigma(j)}$

The probability generating functions are FPS such that (with joint PMF coefficient)

$$
1 = \sum_{\sigma\in\mathbb{N}^k} f(\sigma)
\qquad
\forall \sigma\in\mathbb{N}^k . 0 \leq f(\sigma)
$$

Second order PGFs: from $\mathbb{N}^k\to\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{N}^l\to (\mathbb{R}[[U]])$
Used to encode linear functions $PGF\to PGF$.

To encode a function $f: R[[U]] \to R[[X]]$, use the following formal power series (joint PMF)

$$
\sum_{\tau\in\mathbb{N}^l} f(\tau) \mathbb{U}^{\tau}
\qquad
f(\tau) \in R[[X]]
$$

First order PGFs can be encoded in this way, simply let $\mathbf{X} = \langle \rangle$ i.e. the empty sequence.

To apply a transform $T: SOP\to SOP$

$$
\sum_{\tau\in\mathbb{N}^l} T(f(\tau)) \mathbb{U}^{\tau}
$$

### linear SOP transformer equivalence check

- linearity, just check equality on point mass PMF is sufficient
- The generalized Dirac SOP input: $\prod_i {(1-X_i U_i)}^{-1} = \sum_{\sigma} (0+X^\sigma )U^\sigma$ all point mass PGF is encoded.

### the pGCL and ReDiP language

### overview of their approach

1. To tackle the program equivalence problem, they defined the PGF transformer semantics.
2. They showed that (at least for loop-free programs) the PGF transformers of ReDiP programs are linear.
3. They developed techniques for solving this problem.

- deciding equivalence of two linear PGF transforms.
- deciding equality for all point-mass PGF inputs.
- deciding equivalence of two linear SOP transformers.
- deciding equality on the generalized Dirac SOP.

The PGF semantics of ReDiP programs can be generalized to SOP semantics, which also preserves closed form (at least for loop-free programs)

## question

### limitation 1: do we really need full distribution information

The authors of the PRODIGY paper argues that techniques for evaluating probability of events and moments of variables are sometimes insufficient since they let-go tiny perturbations which may leave vulnerabilities undetected.
The argument is not examplified by concrete examples nor supportted by quantitative calculations, which puts its validity in doubt.

For example, consider two probabilistic programs that output $X_1$ and $X_2$ respectively.
We can symbolically evaluate and compare $D(X_1) - D(X_2)$ with $0$ to check whether $X_1$ and $X_2$ have the same distribution.

$$
D(X) = (\mathbb{E}(X^k); \Pr(X>\mathbb{E}X/k)) \quad k=1,2,3\ldots 10
$$

We deem that such method is good enough even in security critical scenarios.

One future research may compare the suitability of PGF based techniques and statistics based technique in the verification of real-world programs.

### extension 1: what if we are interested in only a subset of valid inputs

The Leibniz equivalence (indistinguishable for arbitrary input $f=g$ iff $\forall x. f(x)=g(x)$).
We Often just need to check $\forall x \in S . f(x) = g(x)$.

One of such scenario is that in a performance critical program, we may be able to apply certain optimization whose correctness can only be proved in a certain context.
Say that in one branch, we know that the program state $x$ satisfies $P(x)$. We may want to check $\forall x . P(x) \to (f(x)=g(x))$.

In a flexible programming language, such equivalence checking can be formulated readily:

```haskell
-- input: x
-- prog: a program that handles input x such that P(x) is true
-- cond: the P(x) predicate
restrict :: (a -> Bool) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> Maybe b)
restrict cond prog input = if cond input
                           then Just (prog input)
                           else Nothing

-- check equivalence: (restrict p f) (restrict p g)
```

However, ReDiP imposes rather strict constraints on guards, making some predicate not expressible.

How can we lift the rectangular constraint is a valuable future research direction.

### extension 2: incorporating real-valued variable using CF/MGF

PGF is essentially the Z transform of the joint PMF.
To enable support for continuous random variables, one may try replacing PGFs with CFs, which are Laplace transform of the joint PDF.

However, introducing Laplance transform may break the closed-form preservation property of ReDiP programs (that is, a rational PGF get transformed into another rational PGF),
potentially making equivalence checking undecidable.

Future works may explore effective and efficient way to add support for continuous random variables.

### extension 3: checking equivalence of reactive programs

Cryptographic systems and automated driving systems are often open-ended reactive system, meaning that they never halt (or terminate).

PRODIGY, however, can only tackle UAST programs, so it is incapable of verifying reactive systems.
For example, PRODIGY will not able to check the equivalence of the following two programs:

```python
# program 1
init1()
while True:
    input()
    update1()
    output1()

# program 2
init2()
while True:
    input()
    update2()
    output2()
```

It remains to be explored how to formulate the PGF transformer semantics for reactive systems.
